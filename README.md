# Identifying the Impact of Body Measurements on Dry Weight

The purpose of this research project was to identify body measurements to accurately estimate dry weight. This was important to find reliable body parts due to specimens losing them when preserved for years. This would play a big role in ecological research and conservation efforts.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**: ggplot2
- **Tools**: GitHub

## Data

The data was collected by my colleague and I, 600+ bees were weighted and 10 of each species were measured for head width and intertegular distance. In this study, I examined ten different bee species across three different families. 

## Results 
Head width and intertegular distance were the most significant predictors of dry weight across and within species. Intertegular distance was also significant in specimens with missing body parts, indicating this measurement is somewhat robust to specimen damage.
